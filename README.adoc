_If you're reading this on github.com, please note that this is the readme for the development  version and that some features described here might not yet have been released.
You can find the documentation for latest version through http://docs.datastax.com/en/developer/java-driver/[DataStax Docs] or via the release tags, e.g.
https://github.com/datastax/java-driver/tree/4.17.0[4.17.0]._

A modern, feature-rich and highly tunable Java client library for http://cassandra.apache.org/[Apache Cassandra®] (2.1+) and  https://www.datastax.com/products/datastax-enterprise[DataStax Enterprise] (4.7+), and https://www.datastax.com/products/datastax-astra[DataStax Astra], using exclusively Cassandra's binary protocol and Cassandra Query Language (CQL) v3.

== Getting the driver

The driver artifacts are published in Maven central, under the group id http://search.maven.org/#search%7Cga%7C1%7Cg%3A%22com.datastax.oss%22[com.datastax.oss];
there are multiple modules, all prefixed with `java-driver-`.

<dependency>
  <groupId>com.datastax.oss</groupId>
  <artifactId>java-driver-core</artifactId>
  <version>${driver.version}</version>

Note that the query builder is now published as a separate artifact, you'll need to add the dependency if you plan to use it.

Refer to each module's manual for more details (link:manual/core/[core], link:manual/query_builder/[query builder], link:manual/mapper[mapper]).

== Compatibility

The driver is compatible with Apache Cassandra® 2.1 and higher, DataStax Enterprise 4.7 and higher, and DataStax Astra.

It requires Java 8 or higher.

Disclaimer: Some DataStax/DataStax Enterprise products might partially work on big-endian systems, but DataStax does not officially support these systems.

== Connecting to DataStax Astra

The driver comes with built-in support for Astra, DataStax's cloud-native Cassandra-as-a-service offering.
See the dedicated link:manual/cloud/[manual page] for more details.

== Migrating from previous versions

Java Driver 4 is *not binary compatible* with previous versions.
However, most of the concepts remain unchanged, and the new API will look very familiar to 2.x and 3.x users.

See the link:upgrade_guide/[upgrade guide] for details.

== Error Handling

See the https://www.datastax.com/blog/cassandra-error-handling-done-right[Cassandra error handling done right blog] for error handling with the Java Driver for Apache Cassandra&trade;.

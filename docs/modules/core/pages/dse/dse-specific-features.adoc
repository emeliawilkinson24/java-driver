== DSE-specific features

Some driver features only work with DataStax Enterprise:

* link:graph/[Graph];
* link:geotypes/[Geospatial types];
* Proxy and GSSAPI authentication (covered in the link:../authentication/[Authentication] page).

Note that, if you don't use these features, you might be able to exclude certain dependencies in order to limit the number of JARs in your classpath.
See the link:../integration/#driver-dependencies[Integration] page.

= DSE-specific features

Some driver features only work with DataStax Enterprise:

* xref:core:dse/graph/about-graph.adoc[Graph];
* xref:core:dse/geotypes.adoc[Geospatial types];
* Proxy and GSSAPI authentication (covered in the xref:core:authentication.adoc[Authentication] page).

Note that, if you don't use these features, you might be able to exclude certain dependencies in order to limit the number of JARs in your classpath.
See the xref:core:integration.adoc#driver-dependencies[Integration] page.

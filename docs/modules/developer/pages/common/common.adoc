This covers utilities or concept that are shared throughout the codebase:

* the link:context/[context] is what glues everything together, and your primary entry point to extend the driver.
* we explain the two major approaches to deal with link:concurrency/[concurrency] in the driver.
* the link:event_bus/[event bus] is used to decouple some of the internal components through asynchronous messaging.

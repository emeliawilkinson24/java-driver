= Developer docs

This section explains how driver internals work.
The intended audience is:

* driver developers and contributors;
* framework authors, or architects who want to write advanced customizations and integrations.

Most of this material will involve "internal" packages;
see link:../api_conventions/[API conventions] for more explanations.

We recommend reading about the link:common/[common infrastructure] first.
Then the documentation goes from lowest to highest level:

* link:native_protocol/[Native protocol layer]: binary encoding of the TCP payloads;
* link:netty_pipeline/[Netty pipeline]: networking and low-level stream management;
* link:request_execution/[Request execution]: higher-level handling of user requests and responses;
* link:admin/[Administrative tasks]: everything else (cluster state and metadata).

If you're reading this on GitHub, the `.nav` file in each directory contains a suggested order.
